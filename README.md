# TruTransit

## TruTransit is my open source community based Transit App.  My goal is to allow developers all over the world that live in major metropolitan areas with public transportation to contribute their city's transit information into the app.

We get our data directly from the MTA. 

Get the exact time your NYC MTA Bus will arrive! Track your daily NYC MTA Bus in real time along its route! Currently only serving the NYC 5 borough area.
